# Google Books Command Line API

**Project Description**:

This program allows users to access the Google Books API. Users can search for books using a keyword. To help specify their search, they can state if the keyword relates to a title, author, subject, or publisher, and then add an optional final second keyword. Users can also simply search for a keyword without specificity as well.

The user is then able to browse books by the top 5 search results and can add them to a Reading List. Users can view the Reading List as well.

**Technologies**

Written in Python 3.7.3

**Running the Program**:

Run the program with the command python main.py in the command line.

**Prerequisites**

json, requests, and sys modules are used in the program but no packages need to be installed for it to run.

**Tests**

Tests are run with Pytest. To do so, you must first install Pytest via the command line:

'pip install pytest' 

Several tests have been included, created and tested with pytest. This is a section which can be expanded upon in the future. To run the tests as given, the code at the bottom of main.py which instantiates the objects and starts the program must be commented out. A comment in the main.py code itself shows where the code must be commented out to run the tests.

**Code Description**:

This project is built in Python3 using OOP. Imported Python libraries include json, requests, and sys to assist in reading the JSON info from Google Books and with exiting the program.
